## Real-time-Lost-and-Found-Object-Detection-using-Edge-Fog-Cloud-Architecture
A tool to find lost objects

In today’s crowded environments such as college campuses, offices, and public places, items like bags, books, or personal belongings are often misplaced or left unattended. The traditional lost-and-found process relies on manual reporting and human monitoring, which is time - consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. 
With the increasing availability of smart cameras and computing resources, there is a need for an automated system that can detect unattended objects in real-time, analysing these events locally, and provide a way to notify users or administrators.
